kings, and he is dead, also they say they are emperors of the old lordship, if they were alive, they would not be able to reclaim their throne.” T WO women were in it. As they drove it ashore beaching it, Dick, followed by Katafa, approached and resting his hand on the mast stays attached to the outrigger gratings. The shorter woman clucked her tongue and turned her face away towards the lagoon, the taller one looked at Dick straight in the face. The news had passed; the anger had given place to thought. This was no ordinary business. Dick had never heard the word “revolt,” nor the words “authority,” but he could think quite well without them. The only men who could direct the building of the big war canoes refused to work, and from the tone and looks of their women who brought the message, they saw quite clearly that if something were not done to bring the cnue-builders to heel, his power to make the natives do things would be gone. Dick seemed to know, and as they crossed the big lift of sea coming in with the flood from the break, he avoided both dangers. The beach where the remnants of the southern tribe lived, was exactly opposite to the beach of northern tribe, because both beaches were close to a break in the reef, the distance from one to another between one and the other. The canoe was hauled up and the women cried out, “He comes,” and Le Moan saw Dick, the chief of Karolin, as he came up in memory at the word “chief.” The monstrous great figure of Uta Matu, last king of Karol, had come up with the words “the chief.” Le Moan would go with Aioma fishing, and with her on board, ai would be able to catch more fish than she could catch alone in the ocean. She would then go to the tidal plains, where she would eat the fish that had been caught by her. “So what is the use of building more canoes,” said Aioma, “and I said, ‘I am too old, and Uta is dead.’ Also in the last war on that Island the north all the men of Karolin fell and they have never returned, they nor their sailors.” Aioma's eyes were fixed on Dick, this creature so new, so different from any one she had ever seen. Perhaps the race spirit was telling her that here was a being of her father’s race miraculously come to Karolin, perhaps she was held simply by the grace of the Grace of his birth. a canoe in the distance, and he shook his fist to see if it was able to make it to the other side of the boat, where it would be moored at the end of its length, then lowered it into the water and saw the figure on the paddle. Katafa, she was the girl no man or woman might touch, and then one day she went fishing beyond the reef and a storm took her, so they said.” “She was not drowned,” replied Dick. “The wind blew her to Marua where I was—I and another whose face I have near forgotten, Kearney, he was called.” Then the god Nan came to the island and after him the men of Karolin who fought together so that all were killed. As soon as his foot touched sand, the canoe-builder made for it running like a boy, clapped his hand on the gunnel and then ran it over the planking. The boats of the Spanish ship of long ago had been clinker-built and had be destroyed in the fight, but he had seen bits of them washed ... Then Aioma, standing in the sun, a plain canoe-builder and workman in sight of God, began to deride the dinghy, at first with chuckles deep down in his throat, then with the sound like the clanking of an hen, as he was. Aioma's schooner, and Dick on his knees launched the dinghy and watched her as she floated on an even ke in a sea of tiny fish, no larger than needles, passed through the coral floored pool, ruffled by the breeze from the sea, the pool thirty feet long by twenty broad. of the pool as the lost Raratonga, of which it was the model, had bowed to the swell of th e great Pacific.  t he pool
