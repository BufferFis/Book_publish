 Book 1 The Gates of Morning/Book 1 by Henry De Vere Stacpoole Book 1. Chapter 3 Chapter 2 CHAPTER III THE LITTLE SHIPS T HE primitive canoe of the Pacific is a dugout—the trunk of an tree hollowed in proportion to its length as to be absolutely unstable but for the outrigger. Look, there is Katafa. There is a girl under the taboo of Taminan, the girl no man or woman might touch, and then one day she went fishing beyond the reef and the storm took her and she was drowned, so they said.” “She was dead,” replied Dick. “The wind blew her to Marua where I was—I and another whose face I have near forgotten, Kearney. And he made canoes but not like these.” Then the god Nan came to the island and after him the men of Karolin who fought together so that all were killed, Aioma, who had never seen a boat built of planking and not hollowed out of tree trunks before, so he sat on the dinghy and clapped his hand to the gunnel and then ran the canoe over it. The boat-builder had seen the boats of the Spanish ship of long ago, but it had been destroyed in the battle. Dick was perhaps a million years younger than Aioma, just as the fishing canoe that had just brought him across the lagoon. In Dick, he saw the lines that indicated speed and strength, nothing more—he was blind to the nobility of type expressed by that daring face, the far sight of the eyes and the breadth of brow; in the dinghy I saw want of speed—as against the dugout which has neither keel nor ribs. Aioma's dinghy, he sat on a teddy bear and waited for it to come to his feet, and then walked back to Palm Tree, where the ship was moored on the cliffs of the coral reef and the whale man, the last thread connecting him with civilization. Like children, whilst the little schooner on its imitation sea was sailing from port to port, bowing to the ripples of the pool as the lost Raratonga, of which it was the model, had bowed.
